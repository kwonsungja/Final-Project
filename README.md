## Documentation
### Subject
* Target Audience: Middle and high school beginner-level students.
### Data Introduction
* Identifying nouns that end with -s, -ss, -sh, -ch, -x, -z, -o, or -y in middle and high school textbooks can be challenging.
* To simplify learning, basic and simple nouns are applied instead.
### Aims
#### Objective: To enhance understanding and application of the basic rules for forming regular plural nouns.
#### Rules Covered:
1. Add -s to the singular noun (e.g., cat → cats).
2. Add -es to nouns ending in -s, -ss, -sh, -ch, -x, -z, or -o (e.g., box → boxes).
3. For nouns ending in -y preceded by a consonant, change -y to -ies (e.g., baby → babies).
#### Challenge: Students often struggle to determine whether to use -s, -es, or -ies after singular nouns.
#### Outcome:
